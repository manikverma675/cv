		<h2><strong>2.Pet:</strong></h2>
  
		<p><h3>Release date: January 6</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Director: Takahiro Omori</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Animation production: Geno Studio</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Available on:Amazon Prime</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Synopsis:</h3></p><h3>Pet is a real mindscrew, in more ways than one. 
		Based on Ranjō Miyake's manga of the same name, the series follows Tsukasa and Hitomi, two empaths with the ability to delve inside the minds of others and manipulate their memories and perceptions.
		Employed by a shadowy organization known simply as "The Company," the pair are tasked with using their abilities to cover up crimes, assassinations, and commit all sorts of unsavory acts, more often than not at the expense of innocent lives and their own fractured psyches.
		The dialogue can be frustratingly obtuse at times, with crucial terms like "peaks" and "valleys" thrown out of left field with little if any formal explanation, and the initial episodes can be a bit hard to follow with regard to what is being seen or perceived by whom at any given moment. 
		Hang in there, though -- it's a story that gradually makes more sense the longer it goes on and rewards the closer you pay attention. And barring even that, it's still worth a watch for the psychedelic visuals alone. 
		Think of it as a more freakish take on Christopher Nolan's Inception by way of Philip K. Dick's Ubik.</h3>

		<h2><strong>3. Somali and the Forest Spirit</strong></h2>
  
		<p><h3>Release date: January 9</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Director: Kenji Yasuda</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Animation production: Satelight</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Available on: Crunchyroll </h3></p>
		<p><h3>Synopsis:</h3></p><h3>If your tastes veer more towards the whimsical fare of Studio Ghibli than explicitly action-oriented titles, Somali and the Forest Spirit is a perfect choice.
		Set in a world of magic and sorcery populated by spirits, goblins, and all sorts of creatures, the series follows the journey of a forest-protecting golem and their companion, a precocious child named Somali. 
		Together, the two embark on a search for a home for Somali among the last of the humans, a race of beings previously thought to have been persecuted and hunted to the brink of extinction ages ago. 
		Think Alphonse and Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, but instead of two brothers in search of the philosopher's stone to restore their bodies, it's a father figure and their adoptive ward searching for safety and security in a world of dangers at every turn. 
		With exquisite backgrounds, disarming humor, and a story with genuine emotional pull, Somali and the Forest Spirit is a spirited fable of parenthood and love found in the most unlikely of circumstances. </h3>

		<h2><strong>4.In/Spectre</strong></h2>
  
		<p><h3>Release date: January 11</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Director: Keiji Gotoh</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Animation production: Brain's Base</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Available on: Crunchyroll </h3></p>
		<p><h3>Synopsis:</h3></p><h3>Supernatural mystery series are a dime a dozen when it comes to anime, so it’s refreshing when one comes along that has as intriguing a premise and personality as In/Spectre.
		Based on Kyo Shirodaira’s novel series, In/Spectre follows 15-year-old Iwanaga Kotoko, a university student who four years prior to the series’s start was anointed as the "Goddess of Wisdom" of the spirit world at the cost of her left leg and right eye. 
		Acting as an intermediary between the human and spirit world, Kotoko is tasked with solving disputes and discrepancies between the two. There’s just one problem: Kuro Sakuragawa, Kotoko’s fast-made companion and boyfriend, is a surprisingly fearsome entity with mysterious powers that strike fear in the spirits who Kotoko is charged with protecting. 
		A serial mystery crossed with an odd-couple rom-com that occasionally pokes at the fourth wall, In/Spectre is a gorgeously animated series with fun twists, delightful characters, and engrossing cases that'll keep you hooked to the end.</h3>

		<h2><strong>5.Keep your Hands off Eizouken!</strong></h2>
  
		<p><h3>Release date: January 5</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Director: Masaaki Yuasa</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Animation production:Science Saru</h3></p>
		<p><h3>Available on: Crunchyroll </h3></p>
		<p><h3>Synopsis:</h3></p><h3>Based on Sumito Ōwara's manga series of the same name, Keep Your Hands off Eizouken! follows high schooler Midori and her friends Sayaka and Tsubame as they attempt to establish an anime club on their school's campus and produce their own animated film.
		What follows is a wild odyssey of the highs and lows of trying to break into animation, the type of comedic and disarmingly earnest portrayal of youthful ambition in the face of opposition, and inexperience that reaffirms why you fell in love with anime in the first place. 
		Brimming with meticulous nods to some of the medium's finest creators and a mischievously meta sense of creativity that'll have even the most stone-faced of viewers grinning ear to ear, it's the kind of show you could only expect from the likes of Masaaki Yuasa (Devilman Crybaby, Ping Pong the Animation, etc.) and the team behind Science Saru. 
		Top that with an infectiously trippy title theme and score courtesy of rap duo chelmico and experimental producer Oorutaichi and you've got one of the most memorable and hilarious anime of the year. </h3>
